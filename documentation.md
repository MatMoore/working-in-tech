How to create excellent documentation.

## [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

> Architecture for agile projects has to be described and defined differently. Not all decisions will be made at once, nor will all of them be done when the project begins.

## [6 Lessons I learned while implementing technical RFCs as a decision making tool](https://buriti.ca/6-lessons-i-learned-while-implementing-technical-rfcs-as-a-management-tool-34687dbf46cb)

> Giving team members, present, and future, the context into why and how decisions have been made has allowed me to run happier and more effective distributed engineering organizations. Now, instead of trying to inadequately respond when I’m asked “what were these people thinking?”, I point to files that may be able to resolve all doubts and allow members of my team to wear the software historian hat.

## [How to Stop Endless Discussions](https://candost.blog/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/)

> The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has a specific timeframe and everyone can give feedback on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted publicly. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.

# Working in tech

"Working in tech" is a directory of links about working in the tech industry, focusing primarily on software engineering.

I'm mainly using this as a memory dump so that I can refer back to useful things that I've read, but I hope it's also useful to other people working in tech or considering a career in this industry.

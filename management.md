# Management

Advice on how to manage reports/how to work with line managers.

## [The new manager 1:1: nurturing employee resiliency during disruption and change](https://blogs.microsoft.com/latinx/2020/05/11/the-new-manager-11-nurturing-employee-resiliency-during-disruption-and-change/)

> This simple connection point between an employee and their manager has long been studied by our Workplace Analytics team, and in what academics call ‘leader-member exchange’ research in organization science. Research hasn’t considered the current work environment, though, and so we set out to answer questions about how 1:1 meetings between managers and their direct reports have evolved in our organization, and how these meetings have impacted employees. Our findings confirm the significant power of this very simple meeting in a manager’s toolkit and shed new light on how it can help stabilize an organization during disruption.

"Working in tech" is a directory of links about working in the tech industry.

It's about the "people side" of software engineering. As a software engineer who has been working in tech for a while, I'm really interested in questions like:

- how should effective software teams be organised?
- how do you raise engineering standards within a team or organisation?
- how do you create a friendly and inclusive environment to work in?
- how do you preserve knowledge of how stuff works?
- how do you maximise the usefulness of software?

I'm mainly using this as a memory dump so that I can refer back to useful things that I've read, but I hope it's also useful to other people working in tech or considering a career in this industry.

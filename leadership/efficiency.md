How to maximise the output of an engineering team

## [DORA research program](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html)

> DORA's State of DevOps research program represents six years of research and data from over 31,000 professionals worldwide. It is the longest running academically rigorous research investigation of its kind, providing an independent view into the practices and capabilities that drive high performance in technology delivery and ultimately organizational outcomes.

> Through six years of research, the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team has identified four key metrics that indicate the performance of a software development team. Four Keys allows you to collect data from your development environment (such as GitHub or GitLab) and compiles it into a dashboard displaying these key metrics.

## [Maximizing Developer Effectiveness](https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html)

> In this article, the first of a series, I introduce a framework for maximizing developer effectiveness. Through research I have identified key developer feedback loops, including micro-feedback loops that developers do 200 times a day. These should be optimized so they are quick, simple and impactful for developers. I will examine how some organizations have used these feedback loops to improve overall effectiveness and productivity.

> What do you do if your CEO complains that progress is too slow? While it’s tempting to think you just need to buckle down and “get more done”, more often than not, simply trying to "increase throughput" won’t work, especially if you’ve misdiagnosed the root cause of the problem.

## [High Output Management for (Non-managing) Tech Leads](https://www.g9labs.com/2020/01/04/high-output-management-for-non-managing-tech-leads/)

> If you've worked in tech long enough, you'll hear praise for Andy Grove's High Output Management, oft-praised as a touchstone of technology management (Grove is often referred to as the "Father of the OKR"). A year or so ago, I got to read his book through Harrison Metal's General Management course. What can you apply from the book when you're a tech lead, and not actually a manager?

# Problem solving

## [Why This Opportunity Solution Tree is Changing the Way Product Teams Work](https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/)

> We’ve all had the experience where we’ve had to manage an executive’s pet idea. This is why we have the HiPPO acronym (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion).
>
> These experiences tend to make us shy to engage others in idea generation.
>
> But there’s plenty of research that shows everyone can and should contribute to idea generation.
>
> Fortunately, the tree helps us do that in a structured way. Every solution should connect to an opportunity.

Liberating Structures are a disruptive innovation that can replace more controlling or constraining approaches.

> The format for standups popularized in Agile methodology, unfortunately, isn’t well calibrated for driving efficient product development within a team. The root cause for long development cycles is that decisions weren’t made quickly and frequently. By replacing daily standups with less frequent decision-making meetings, product teams can save themselves lots of wasted time and build products much more quickly.

> I wanted the team to know I trusted them. To know that it’s ok to tackle tech debt, explore, and work at their own pace. I laid out the goals for the quarter and trusted that the work would get done. Then I got the fuck out of the way.

> Would you believe it: work got done. A lot of it.

## [Advanced Pair Programming: Pairing Remotely](https://chelseatroy.com/2017/04/01/advanced-pair-programming-pairing-remotely/)

> If your location or setup separate you from other programmers with whom you would like to pair, it’s absolutely possible to pair remotely. The longer and the more often you’ll be pairing remotely, the more time and money you’ll want to sink into creating a setup that mimics in-person pairing as much as possible.

## [Evaluating the Impact of Pair Testing on Team Productivity and Test Case Quality](https://journal.uet.edu.pk/ojs_old/index.php/pjeas/article/view/1766/328)

> In pair testing, two individuals sit together at one keyboard to test the software. An empirical study was designed and conducted to evaluate the performance of pair testing vis-à-vis conventional testing. Six pairs of testers divided into two different groups — one using pair testing and the other using conventional testing — participated in a controlled experiment involving three separate projects. The productivity of the groups and the quality of their work were quantitatively evaluated and compared. The results of comparison revealed that the group using pair testing spent more effort but the quality of its work was better.

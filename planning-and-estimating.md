# Planning and estimating

Some approaches to planning software engineering work and dealing with uncertainty.

## [Everything is hypothesis driven design](https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2015/07/16/everything-is-hypothesis-driven-design/)

> I think that everything can be seen as hypothesis driven design. The real question is whether or not we write down the assumptions behind the design decisions we make and measure outcomes.

An analogy.

> Anyone who built software for a while knows that estimating how long something is going to take is hard. It's hard to come up with an unbiased estimate of how long something will take, when fundamentally the work in itself is about solving something. One pet theory I've had for a really long time, is that some of this is really just a statistical artifact.

> I wanted the team to know I trusted them. To know that itâ€™s ok to tackle tech debt, explore, and work at their own pace. I laid out the goals for the quarter and trusted that the work would get done. Then I got the fuck out of the way.

> Would you believe it: work got done. A lot of it.

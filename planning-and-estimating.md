# Planning and estimating

Some approaches to planning software engineering work and dealing with uncertainty.

## [Everything is hypothesis driven design](https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2015/07/16/everything-is-hypothesis-driven-design/)

> I think that everything can be seen as hypothesis driven design. The real question is whether or not we write down the assumptions behind the design decisions we make and measure outcomes.

## [Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html)

> Anyone who built software for a while knows that estimating how long something is going to take is hard. It's hard to come up with an unbiased estimate of how long something will take, when fundamentally the work in itself is about solving something. One pet theory I've had for a really long time, is that some of this is really just a statistical artifact.

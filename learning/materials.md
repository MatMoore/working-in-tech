# Learning materials

Some useful materials for learning technical skills.

## Short courses

### [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Free and high quality.

### [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

Quality varies but courses are usually cheap.

### [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

Expensive to subscribe yourself but useful if your organisation pays for it.

### [Upcase trails](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/practice)

> Some trails consist of videos, like our tmux trail. Others use our coding exercises. In those, you'll clone down a git repo and write code on your own machine. The trails are each broken down into clear steps to allow you to tackle them in manageable chunks.

### [Learn technology best practices](https://learn.madetech.com/technology/)

> Resources for improving your programming and software engineering skills.

## Exercises

### [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)

Programming exercises with an option for free code review.

### [Codepip](https://codepip.com/)

Learn to code by playing games.

## Magazines and mailing lists

### [Increment](https://increment.com/)

> While there are a lot of materials about how to write code and how to deploy distributed systems, there's much less about how humans can work together more effectively to achieve their goals faster. This stuff is complicated, and it matters. Version control, code review, pager rotations, DevOps practices. Increment exists to provide practical and useful insight into what effective teams are doing so the rest of us can learn from them more quickly.

### [Software lead weekly](https://softwareleadweekly.com/)

> A weekly email for busy people who care about people, culture and leadership.

### [Python weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com/)

> A free weekly newsletter featuring the best hand curated news, articles, new releases, tools and libraries, events etc related to Python.

### [DB weekly](http://dbweekly.com/)

> A weekly round-up of database technology news and articles covering new developments, SQL, NoSQL, document databases, graph databases, and more.

### [SRE weekly](https://sreweekly.com/)

> SRE Weekly is a newsletter devoted to everything related to keeping a site or service available as consistently as possible. SRE (Site/Service Reliability Engineering) isn’t just about automated failover or fault-tolerant architectures — although of course those are important. It’s about a holistic view of reliability that takes into account everything from servers to human factors to processes to automation and more.

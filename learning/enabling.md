# Enabling learning and development

## [Developing Talent in R&D](https://medium.com/galvanize/developing-talent-in-r-d-3fe7aae3e414)

> Training requires "system thinking" and acknowledging that knowledge and talent do not randomly appear. They appear due to deliberate design and intentional practice.

## [Explicit Direct Instruction in Programming Education](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/explicit-direct-instruction-in-programming-education/)

> While the debate is not settled, more and more evidence is presented by researchers that explicit direct instruction is more effective than exploratory learning in teaching language and mathematics and science. These findings raise the question whether that might be true for programming education too. This is especially of interest since programming education is deeply rooted in the constructionist philosophy, leading many programmers to follow exploratory learning methods, often without being aware of it.

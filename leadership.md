# Leadership

A collection of links about how to make software engineering teams more effective.

## [Driving Cultural Change Through Software Choices](https://skamille.medium.com/driving-cultural-change-through-software-choices-bf69d2db6539)

> All of this is to say that developers have more power than they imagine to change the engineering culture around them. As you build software that others will use or that your peers will work on, are you making it easy for them to do the right thing? If you build platforms, bake in easy integrations for the software values you want to see. If you’re in the position to choose new tools, pick ones that support the standards you want taken seriously. And as you write code, make it easy for others who will copy-paste what you’ve done to then do the right thing.

## [DORA research program](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html)

> DORA's State of DevOps research program represents six years of research and data from over 31,000 professionals worldwide. It is the longest running academically rigorous research investigation of its kind, providing an independent view into the practices and capabilities that drive high performance in technology delivery and ultimately organizational outcomes.

## [GoogleCloudPlatform/fourkeys](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fourkeys)

> Through six years of research, the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team has identified four key metrics that indicate the performance of a software development team. Four Keys allows you to collect data from your development environment (such as GitHub or GitLab) and compiles it into a dashboard displaying these key metrics.

## [Maximizing Developer Effectiveness](https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html)

> In this article, the first of a series, I introduce a framework for maximizing developer effectiveness. Through research I have identified key developer feedback loops, including micro-feedback loops that developers do 200 times a day. These should be optimized so they are quick, simple and impactful for developers. I will examine how some organizations have used these feedback loops to improve overall effectiveness and productivity.

## [How to Manage Your Team in Times of Political Trauma](https://medium.com/awaken-blog/managing-teams-in-times-of-political-trauma-what-to-do-what-to-say-to-boost-psychological-safety-b5782969d6fa)

> When we encourage our teams to “bring their whole selves to work” — remember that this includes acknowledging how their lives are impacted by forces outside the office.

## [The Patient Change Agent](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-patient-change-agent-fd8548f04777)

> So…right or not, when what we’re trying isn’t working…well, it isn’t working.
>
> It is easy to frame this as fixed vs. growth mindset (recently under fire), change resistance/risk aversion, office politics, a power-hungry manager, Theory X vs. Theory Y, pathological vs. bureaucratic vs. generative (Westrum), and good old “they just don’t understand!” Frame away. The reality remains: what you’re trying isn’t working. It doesn’t matter how good your intentions are, how selfless you are (or think you are), how passionate about continuous improvement you are, and/or how inclusive or empowering you’re trying to be…it isn’t working.

## [Maximising involvement in mixed seniority engineering teams](https://craigbass.uk/my-blog/maximising-involvement-in-mixed-seniority-engineering-teams)

> Let’s consider the product strategy. How might leadership guide but devolve it to the whole team?
>
> I think about this as sort of an accessibility problem. Most senior individuals have developed mental models to sense-adapt, navigate, and use their experience to notice gaps or flaws within (mostly) verbally communicated strategies. These strategies then get translated into backlog items, often disconnected from the true value chain and decision making.

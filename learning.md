## [Improv: Teaching Programming at Scale via Live Coding](https://pg.ucsd.edu/publications/Improv-live-coding-in-slide-presentations_LAS-2019.pdf)

> Computer programming instructors frequently perform live coding in settings ranging from MOOC lecture videos to online livestreams. However, there is little tool support for this mode of teaching, so presenters must now either screen-share or use generic slideshow software. To overcome the limitations of these formats, we propose that programming environments should directly facilitate live coding for education. We prototyped this idea by creating Improv, an IDE extension for preparing and delivering code-based presentations informed by Mayerâ€™s principles of multimedia learning.

Resources for learning and teaching technical skills.

## [Explicit Direct Instruction in Programming Education](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/explicit-direct-instruction-in-programming-education/)

> While the debate is not settled, more and more evidence is presented by researchers that explicit direct instruction is more effective than exploratory learning in teaching language and mathematics and science. These findings raise the question whether that might be true for programming education too. This is especially of interest since programming education is deeply rooted in the constructionist philosophy, leading many programmers to follow exploratory learning methods, often without being aware of it.

## [Upcase trails](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/practice)

> Some trails consist of videos, like our tmux trail. Others use our coding exercises. In those, you'll clone down a git repo and write code on your own machine. The trails are each broken down into clear steps to allow you to tackle them in manageable chunks.

## [Improv: Teaching Programming at Scale via Live Coding](https://pg.ucsd.edu/publications/Improv-live-coding-in-slide-presentations_LAS-2019.pdf)

> Computer programming instructors frequently perform live coding in settings ranging from MOOC lecture videos to online livestreams. However, there is little tool support for this mode of teaching, so presenters must now either screen-share or use generic slideshow software. To overcome the limitations of these formats, we propose that programming environments should directly facilitate live coding for education. We prototyped this idea by creating Improv, an IDE extension for preparing and delivering code-based presentations informed by Mayer’s principles of multimedia learning.
